    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
        Flan is a <b>sweet dairy</b> and egg-based custard usually <b>flavored</b> with <b>vanilla</b>. In the English-speaking
         world, this <b>dessert</b> is better known by its French name Crème Caramel (flan is also a word of
          French origin adopted into Spanish).
</p>

<p>
    It has a characteristic caramel-colored topping and sauce, as it is cooked in a pan with the bottom
     covered in hard caramel that dissolves during the cooking process. The caramel prevents the flan
      from sticking to the bottom of the mold, gives its characteristic color, and gives it a faint
       taste of bitterness from the caramel. 
</p>    

<p>
    After cooking, the flan is inverted onto a plate, and the caramel-colored base becomes the top.
