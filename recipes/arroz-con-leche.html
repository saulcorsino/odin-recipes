<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 Cups Cooked White Rice (Long or Medium Grain) </li>
    <li>3 Cups Evaporated Milk </li>
    <li>1 Cup Whole Milk </li>
    <li>1 ½ Cups of Sugar </li>
    <li>2 inch Lime Peel </li>
    <li>3 Cinnamon Sticks </li>
    <li>1 ½ tsp Vanilla Extract </li>
    <li>½ tsp Ground Cloves </li>
    <li>Ground Cinnamon for Garnish</li>
    <li>Sweetened Condensed Milk *optional </li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Clean and rinse rice. Let rice soak in 2 and a half cups of water for 20 minutes. Add 3 cups more of water and the cinnamon stick; simmer over medium fire for 15-17 minutes covered.</li>
    <li>Add, salt, and raisins, and cook covered for another 10 minutes or until the rice is tender (I cook mine for 8 minutes, but the time varies depending on the type of rice used).</li>
    <li>Add the condensed milk, evaporated milk, cinnamon, cloves, lemon zest, and vanilla to the cooked rice. Verify sweetness and add more sugar or condensed milk if you think it is necessary. Cook uncovered on moderate heat for another 7-10 minutes, over medium-low moving constantly to prevent rice pudding from sticking to the pot (I let mine cook for 7 minutes). </li>
    <li>Remove from heat; the consistency should be creamy but on the liquid side since the pudding will thicken much as it cools. After five minutes, discard lemon zest and cinnamon stick. Serve hot or cold, sprinkled with ground cinnamon.</li>

</ol>
